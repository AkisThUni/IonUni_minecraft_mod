# Numerology 

Luck! A rather unique effect that has existed since 1.9. Not exactly obtainable in survival. But what if that were to change? That is what this mod intends to do with its own little "twist"

Fun Fact: Numerology is the ancient occult, mysticism and esotericism (magic) between events and numbers.

## Unique mechanics and additions.

Numerology revolves around making obtainable with easy means the luck and bad luck status effect. One of the core gameplay mechanics we added is giving a unique right click ability as an upgrade to some tools, allowing them to roll a "d20" die (a 20-sided virtual dice) and give positive or negative effects.
